/*
 In the statement "scanf(%f, p + i)", "p + i" is the address of the memory location which is being incremented with each iteration.

 In the first iteration where i = 0:
      -> p + i = p + 0 = p => This means the pointer is pointing to the address of the first element present in the allocated memory block.

 In the second iteration where i = 1:
      -> p + i = p + 1 => The pointer value will be incremented by 1 and now it will point to the address of the second element present in the allocated memory block.

 In the subsequent iterations, the pointer will be incremented by 1 and using scanf() function we will store value at each element's address in the allocated memory block.

 Note: This is the concept of Increment/Decrement of the pointer variable covered in the topic of 'Pointers'.
